class AudioFileTaggingService:
    """Service for applying metadata tags to audio files.

    Pipeline Overview:
    ==================
    1. apply_metadata_tags() - Main entry point: writes all metadata to audio file
    2. _write_basic_metadata() - Applies core tags (title, artist, album)
    3. _write_track_numbering() - Applies track position information
    4. _write_year_metadata() - Parses and applies release year
    5. _write_cover_art() - Embeds album artwork into the file

    Why use mediafile: The mediafile library provides a unified interface for
    tagging multiple audio formats (MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.) with proper format-specific
    handling (ID3 tags for MP3, Vorbis comments for FLAC, etc.).

        What gets written:
        - Basic metadata: title, artist(s), album, album artist(s)
        - Track numbering: track position and total tracks

                auto-detects MIME type from magic bytes.

        Raises:
