    Pipeline Overview:
    ==================
    1. compose() - Main entry point: orchestrates M3U and cover generation
                   based on configuration flags and content type
    2. _collect_successful_tracks_for_playlist() - Filters download results
                   to include only successful and skipped tracks (both should
                   appear in the final playlist)
    3. Delegates to utility functions (write_m3u, write_playlist_cover) for
       actual file generation

    This service is stateless and operates purely on the results of completed
    downloads. It does not perform any downloads or API calls itself.

    Example:
        >>> composer = PlaylistArtifactsService()
        >>> artifacts = composer.compose(
        ...     base_path=Path("./music"),
        ...     playlist_info=playlist_info,
        ...     results=download_results,

        >>> artifacts.m3u   # Path or None

        This is the main composition pipeline. It takes completed download results

        different albums and folders.

        Why include skipped tracks: Both SUCCESS and SKIPPED tracks should appear
        in the playlist. SKIPPED means the file already existed and was not
        re-downloaded, but it's still part of the playlist.
